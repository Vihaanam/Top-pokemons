            <h2 class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><kbd>1. Zygarde</kbd></h2>
            <img class="img-responsive col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-10" src="Zygarde.png">
            <h2 class="text-center col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><kbd>Zygarde is super-strong</kbd></h2>
            <p class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 text_des text-center">Zygarde is actually one of my favourite of all. Not as large as it seems in its core and cell forms. Cores are its brains, cells like its body cells.
                These, (10% of them) when fused together form something like a dog. (50%) a snake and (100%) a humanoid dragon type. The 100% forme is stronger than Xerneas and Yveltal.
            </p>
            <h2 class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><kbd>2. Mewtwo</kbd></h2>
            <img class="img-responsive col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-10" src="Mewtwo.png">
            <h2 class="text-center col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><kbd>Mewtwo is strongly strong</kbd></h2>
            <p class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 text_des text-center">Mewtwo is another one of my favourite of all. Mewtwo is a psychic. Probably the strongest psychic.
                Mewtwo is the marvel of the man-made. Its mega evolution (X and Y) are more stronger, especially with Mega Mewtwo X being a psychic and fighting. Mewtwo has become one of many populars at the second-highest position (Pikachu at first) in history.

            <h2 class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><kbd>3. Arceus</kbd></h2>
            <img class="img-responsive col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-10" src="Arceus.png">
            <h2 class="text-center col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><kbd>Arceus is superbly strong</kbd></h2>
            <p class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 text_des text-center">Arceus is like the god of all. The incredible ability of changing types with different plates is such that Arceus now has 18 types. All of which I have displayed at <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/lvGbIxWn9r2nc25i89yWULNafg8cwWVqrFNsLutVbK4" target="_blank">Legendary and mythical pokemons</a>.
                Another thing is that it is the trio master of two trios, the Lake Guardians and the Creation Trio. It so ranks as superbly strong.
